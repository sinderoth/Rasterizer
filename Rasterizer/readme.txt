Rasterizer implementing the Forward Rendering Pipeline.

Specifically, given a set of triangles
and the position and the color attributes of all of their vertices, rendering the scene as a
two-dimensional image.

Triangle rasterization algorithm to display the triangles in wireframe or solid modes.
